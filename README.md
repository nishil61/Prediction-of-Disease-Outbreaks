- Select the machine learning model you want to use (e.g., Random Forest, SVM).
- Train the model on the preprocessed data.

### **3. Disease Outbreak Prediction**
- Input real-time data (e.g., environmental conditions, population density).
- The system will predict the likelihood of a disease outbreak in the specified region.

### **4. Visualize Results**
- View predictions in the form of graphs, charts, and tables.
