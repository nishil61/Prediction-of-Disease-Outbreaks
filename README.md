## **Project Overview**

The **Prediction of Disease Outbreaks** project is a machine learning-based solution designed to forecast the likelihood of disease outbreaks in specific regions using historical and real-time data. The goal is to enable early detection and prevention by providing health authorities with actionable insights to implement necessary public health measures.

This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze environmental, demographic, and historical disease data, making it a powerful tool for proactive public health management.

## **Installation Guide**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps to Install and Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishil61/Prediction-of-Disease-Outbreaks.git
   cd Prediction-of-Disease-Outbreaks
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Optional but Recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit App**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   If the above command doesn't work than kindly use the following command:
   ```bash
   python -m streamlit run app.py
   ```

6. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

## **Usage**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Upload your dataset (CSV format) through the Streamlit interface.
- The system will automatically preprocess the data (handle missing values, outliers, etc.).

### **2. Model Training**
- Select the machine learning model you want to use (e.g., Random Forest, SVM).
- Train the model on the preprocessed data.

### **3. Disease Outbreak Prediction**
- Input real-time data (e.g., environmental conditions, population density).
- The system will predict the likelihood of a disease outbreak in the specified region.

### **4. Visualize Results**
- View predictions in the form of graphs, charts, and tables.
- Export results for further analysis.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project includes:
- **Historical Disease Data**: Records of past disease outbreaks.
- **Environmental Data**: Weather conditions, temperature, humidity, etc.
- **Demographic Data**: Population density, age distribution, etc.

---

## **Methodology**

### **1. Data Collection**
- Data is collected from various sources, including public health databases, environmental sensors, and demographic records.

### **2. Data Preprocessing**
- Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Normalize and scale the data for better model performance.

### **3. Feature Engineering**
- Extract relevant features (e.g., temperature, humidity, population density).
- Perform feature selection to improve model accuracy.

### **4. Model Selection**
- Evaluate multiple machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost).
- Select the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### **5. Model Training**
- Train the selected model on the preprocessed data.
- Use cross-validation to ensure robustness.

### **6. Deployment**
- Deploy the model using Streamlit for real-time predictions.
